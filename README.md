# BTTConverterDesktop
BTTConverter for Desktop

When converting files in **BTTConverterDesktop**, make sure that the folder you set the root directory to is properly formatted. Name the folder **BTTRecorder**. Inside of that folder, make a folder with the name of the language code of the file (eg. en for English). Inside, make a folder with the name of the type of Bible (eg. ulb for Unlocked Literal Bible). Then, create a folder with the abbreviated name of the book in question (eg. mrk for Mark, luk for Luke etc.). Then likewise, have folders inside for the chapters of the book. With the verse files in here, **BTTConverterDesktop** will not only see the files, but will also be able to convert them successfully.
